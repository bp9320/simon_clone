          <h2>Welcome to my color pattern memorization game!</h2>

          <p>
            This game came about when trying to come up with ideas for projects
            to build to practice my JavaScript. When thinking about games from
            the past that would be fun to clone, the classic pattern matching
            game
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)" target="_blank"
              >Simon</a
            >
            came to mind. After mentioning the idea to my kid who gave it a
            thumbs up, it was time to get to work.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Play</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After reading the instructions, click the start button to reveal
              the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              A 3 second countdown will run, then the first colored circle will
              appear.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the pattern display circle says "GO!", click on the circle
              with the same color that was previously displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you clicked the correct colored circle, pattern display circle
              will fade out and the pattern will play again, adding an
              additional, randomly selected color to the end of the pattern each
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you click on an incorrect circle, the game will end, and you
              will be notified of how many rounds you successfully completed.
            </li>
          </ul>
